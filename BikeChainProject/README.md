- ~~Checkout button~~
- Return bike button (change coordinates for bike to user's current coordinates)
- Modal to lease a bike

- Ask about judgement

## Inspiration
Zip car was a service that was seen as a disruptive technology because it allowed people to find cars, pay for them and then unlock a car and go. Citi bike rentals is privately owned, but a flaw that discourages the use is displacement of bicycles in different parts of the city. To promote the use of bike transportation, the citi bikes needs to be more available beyond their kiosks. This is where Bike Chain comes in,
## What it does
Using block chain technology to make a decentralized system for transactions, Bike Chain is a web application that connects users to a crowd sourced network of bikes in any city or town that makes bikes more accessible, easier pay for, and holds more accountability to users to maintain the bikes.
## How we built it
We used vite.js to create the web application, we utilized the Tailwind.css to make it easier to style the front end, Google maps api to make a map to display our bike network, and attempted to integrate the midnight blockchain's api.
## Challenges we ran into
Finding a map api that we could use that wouldn't require us putting in our credit card information. (Because we're broke college students). We also struggled implementing a deapp just because of time constraints.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of coming up with a proof of concept that gives us hope that web 3 isn't dead and that we were able to create something from skills we learned in our classes. 
## What we learned
24hrs is a long time to be awake for, but not enough time to fully implement a full deapp
## What's next for Bike Chain
uhhhh, hopefully internships or some mentorship.





This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
